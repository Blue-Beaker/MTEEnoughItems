JEI addon for some absent recipe categories in various mods.  
The mod lets player check recipe in JEI for these things from these mods:

- Buildcraft
  - Facade Assembly recipes
- Forestry
  - Peat Engine (fuel, ash output)
  - Biogas engine (fuel, lava consumption)
  - Bio Generator (fuel)
- Railcraft
  - Fluid Fueled Firebox (fuel)
  - Steam Boiler (water to steam conversion)
  - Worldspike (fuel)
- Thermal
  - Fluid conversion (the block converted by pyrotheum, cryotheum, petrotheum, and primal mana on contact)
  - Arboreal Extractor (accepted trees, output fluid, and boosting fertilizers)
- Immersive Engineering
  - Diesel Generator (fuel)
  - Mineral Deposits (Vein weight, dimensions, ores, chances, and average amount)

This mod also adds subtype handlers for these items, so pressing R in JEI no longer jumps to recipes for all the similar items:
- Buildcraft gates and facades
- Storage drawers and Storage drawers extras drawers
